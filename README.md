## Description

During my second year of studying Computer Science, I worked on a 2-semester project which aimed to offer a Pinterest-like experience to the user. The project features an unlimited feed of poems and artworks, accompanied by additional information about their author or conception. I also incorporated some of my favorite pieces of LoFi and piano music to enhance the ambiance.

The primary objective of the project was to provide educational and informative content while also offering a calming experience to users.

Although originally developed as a team project, the design and code are entirely my own work. The code was written with a database in mind, so that users could log in, add artworks to their profile, and view other people's art (followers). However, I chose to focus solely on showcasing my individual work, and therefore the user functionality and database are yet to be implemented.
